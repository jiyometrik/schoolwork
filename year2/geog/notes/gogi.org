   - _few DCS_

** challenges faced (ageing pop.)
*** impacts
+ inc. resources spent on healthcare
+ inc. strain of working class
  - resources diverted
+ labour $ [shortage of young working pop.]
+ dec. productivity
  - most of the working population old \rightarrow not much work done
+ insufficient young to defend country
***  solutions
**** labour shortage
+ inc. retirement age \rightarrow pop. work for more years
  - possible due to inc. life expectancy
+ draw women back into labour force
  - incentives (home-based, part-time, flexi arrangements, childcare subsidies, exemption for maid levies)
**** financial schemes
+ enable pop. to save for retirement
**** healthy lifestyle
+ prevent from degenerating mentally & physically
+ NTUC organises grp. activities (e.g. dances, runs for the elderly)
**** elderly-friendly features in homes
+ hand-rails \rightarrow help elderly move around
+ ramps / sliding chairs \rightarrow wheelchair users
+ emergency btn. / card \rightarrow summon help if needed
**** charitable organisations
+ raise funds with govt. support (SG)
+ subsidised / free medical check-ups (medisave)


* housing
** impacts of housing shortage
*** lack of safe shelter
+ houses made in /slums/ and /squatter settlements/ have weak foundations
+ unstable walls & roofs made of poor quality materials (e.g. zinc and cardboard)
+ houses collapse easily during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes)
+ construction materials are also flammable \rightarrow inc. risk of fire
+ houses built on unsuitable sites (low-lying areas [flood], steep slopes [landslide])
+ houses built in dense, disorderly manner
	- narrow paths, limited access for vehicles
	- residents may not be able to evacuate quickly, rescue efforts hampered
*** insufficient basic services
+ people lack access to basic services (eg. electricity, clean water, proper sanitation, waste disposal)
+ lack of infrastructure (power lines, water pipes, toilets, waste mgmt. facil.)
+ example: *Nairobi, Kenya*
	- lack of proper sanitation
	- toilet shared by up to 1300 residents
	- access to water is inconsistent
		+ water piped into the slum is often diverted away by indiv. residents / private water companies
	- waste accumulates in streets & rivers
		+ lack of waste disposal facilities
** causes of housing shortage
*** rapid pop. growth
+ /urbanisation/: inc. in proportion of the world's pop. living in cities
	- urban pop. inc.; rural pop. dec.
	- asia & africa projected to exp. the largest inc. in % of pop. in urban areas
+ rapid pop. growth \rightarrow inc. demand for housing
+ inc. in urban pop. \rightarrow further pressure on govt. and devs.
+ rural-urban migration + high birth rates \rightarrow rapid pop. growth
*** migration
**** definitions
+ /migration/: mvmt. of ppl. from one area to another, to take up residence for $\geq$ 1 year
+ /rural-urban migration/: mvmt. of ppl. from rural areas to cities
+ /push factors/: undesirable qualities of the place ppl. leave
	- lack of job opportunities
	- poor edu. facil.
	- lack of healthcare services
	- famine, war
+ /pull factors/: attractive qualities of the place ppl. would like to move to
	- job opportunities
	- better schooling, further edu.
	- more hospitals, doctors
	- perception of exciting city life
	- political stability
**** explanation
+ ppl. move to cities in search of a better life
	- attracted by job opp. in cities
+ more jobs created in cities
	- wider range of econ. activities compared to rural areas
**** example
+ *sao paulo, brazil*
+ migrants
	- there may be insufficient jobs to cater to the huge no. of migrants there
	- migrants may also lack skills req. for jobs avail. in cities
	- \therefore difficulty getting jobs, unable to afford housing
+ city
	- unable to build sufficient houses quickly enough
		+ for housing the huge number of migrants
+ \therefore migrants settle in slums
	- may eventually find employment there (small businesses)
*** high birth rate
**** explanation
+ high rates of nat. inc.
	- high b/r, low d/r
	- cities have a large prop. of ppl. in 20s - 30s; likely to start fam.
	- abv. avg. fertility rates \rightarrow high nat.inc.
+ supply-demand
	- cities have to allocate more resourcees to housing \rightarrow cater to the inc. in pop.
	- \because cities may not be able to build houses fast enough
	- \therefore not every couple may be able to live in formal housing
**** example
+ *london, uk*
+ london's pop. increased (rapidly) by 104 000 in 2012-13
	- high b/r, m/r (migration rates)
	- 86 000 more births than deaths
	- foreign-born mothers accounted for > 1/4 of total births
+ have to allocate more resources to housing to cater to inc. in pop.
*** competing land use
**** explanation
+ many uses for land
	- residential (house)
	- commercial (make $)
	- industrial (factories)
	- recreational (have fun)
	- infrastructure (roads, airports, hospitals)
+ competing uses for land \rightarrow stiff competition \rightarrow insufficient land for housing
	- various grps. of people may have conflict of interest
**** example
+ *Singapore*
+ govt. has committed 17% of land supply to housing to cater to a proj. growth in pop.
+ competing land uses have been identified
	- some golf courses in sg will be removed \rightarrow re-dev. for housing / other
*** limited land supply
+ limited land supply of land suitable for housing
	- physical features (seas, rivers, mts.) limit amt. of land that can be used for housing
	- flat land is preferred for dev.; high $ of construction on steep slopes
+ some cities have small land areas (eg. sg - 716 sq km, hk - 1104 sq km)
	- there is a limit to how much land can be reclaimed from the sea
	- small land area \rightarrow insufficient land for housing
+ high pop. dens. (large pop., limited land area)
	- need to house more ppl. in small area
** consequences of housing shortage
*** homelessness
**** explanation
+ -ve impact on one's health
	- exposure to cold / rain
	- hunger, lack of sleep
	- skin infections, respiratory problems, stress disorders
**** example
+ us dept of housing & urban dev. estimates 610 042 homeless ppl. in the us in a single night (jan 2013)
*** slums & squatter settlements
**** env. pollution
***** explanation
+ inadequate provision of basic svcs. \rightarrow env. pollution
+ *water pollution*
	- rivers near slums may be used for /washing/, /garbage/, and /sewage disposal/.
	- contaminants from sewage can seep into groundwater, pollute nearby water sources (e.g. wells)
+ *land pollution*
	- lack of a garbage disposal system \rightarrow dumping of garbage into open drains
		+ foul smell
		+ eyesore
***** example
+ *Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil*
+ 1970s
	- clear waters, white sandy beaches
	- habitat for diverse range of marine animals
+ present
	- floating rubbish, polluted waters
	- disposal of untreated sewage into the bay (nearby slums, squatter settlements)
**** low level of health, due to poor living conds
***** explanation
+ lack of basic services (clean water, proper sanitation) \rightarrow people more vulnerable to diseases
+ no access to safe drinking water
	- use water from polluted rivers, contaminated wells
	- may have bacteria, causing diseases (eg. cholera)
+ lack of waste mgmt. facil.
	- improper disposal of rubbish
	- stagnant waters (clogged drains, sewers) \rightarrow breeding grounds for mosquitoes \rightarrow malaria, dengue
+ overcrowding
	- large family living in a small room
	- houses closely spaced
	- facil. the rapid spread of diseases
***** example
+ *nairobi, kenya*
+ health of children living in slums is generally poorer than in areas with formal housing
+ d/r of children (<5 y/o) living in slums is 2.5 \times higher than in other parts of the city (who, 2008)
**** vulnerability
***** explanation
+ residents more susceptible to the risk of fires, landslides and evictions (see earlier chapter)
+ slums may be built on land w/o perm. from relevant auth.
	- face the threat of eviction
	- lack a sense of sec. \leftarrow may be forced out of their homes
***** example
1. *mumbai, india*
	 + fire in slum destroys 150 houses
		 - more than 100 1-room shacks, rendered families homeless
		 - cause of fire: short circuit (loose electric wires)
2. *rio de janeiro, brazil*
	 + landslides in a favela in r.d.j. \rightarrow 256 ppl. killed (apr 2010)
	 + occurred after a period of heavy rain, a house collapsed down a hill
3. *dhaka, bangladesh*
	 + court order to clear the land issued \rightarrow 40 000 people evicted from korail slum (2012)
	 + social tension between auth. & residents
		 - residents staged protest \rightarrow govt. promised to stop temp. evicting residents
** strategies to manage housing
*** slum upgrading
**** explanation
+ cities improve the quality of housing & basic svcs.
+ slum sites cleared and basic infrastructure provided (the whole house)
+ residents move out and relocate
+ financial schemes & assistance provided
**** advantages
+ residents can be provided with housing relatively quickly with all svcs. covered
**** disadvantages
+ high costs for the govt.
+ some residents may face difficulties paying for the cost
+ residents reluctant to move and be left without a house temp.
**** example
+ *nairobi, kenya*
+ govt. partnered with the un (un-habitat) in a proj. which aims to provide residents with the rights to build on the existing land & improve housing conds. and infra-str.
+ residents shift temporarily to an area with new housing units (equipped with svcs.)
+ vacated slum area upgraded & residents can return to the original sites once complete
*** self-help schemes
**** explanation
+ low income households to improve the cond. of existing housing
+ govt.s do not provide housing directly
	- provide assistance in other forms:
		+ construction materials
		+ basic svcs.
+ ppl. build the houses themselves
	- at their own pace / in free time (after work / weekends)
	- training provided by govt.
**** advantages
+ reduced construction costs
**** disadvantages
+ training needs to be provided
	- even then, still has chance of being dangerous
+ the pace of construction is slow due to schedule clashes etc.
**** example
+ *rocinha project, brazil*
+ most wooden houses replaced by concrete houses
+ 75% of homes have electricity (compared to 30% in the past)
+ rooftop water tanks, piped water systems
+ sanitation facilities (eg. toilets, sewers)
*** public housing
**** explanation
+ govt. efforts to provide housing units with basic svcs.
	- usu. for low-income hh. + other persons of need (elderly, disabled)
+ reasonably priced (compared to private housing)
	- subsidised by govt.
+ other methods of public housing
	- old flats may be rented at a low price
	- abandoned buildings converted for residential use
	- new apartments built
**** advantages
+ low cost (for both govt. and people)
**** disadvantages
+ may be difficult to roll out in a larger country due to the sheer number of residents such a scheme would have to cater to (diff. local issues to be managed)
**** example
1. *singapore*
	 + 1960-70s: slums / squatter settlements had to be cleared \rightarrow provide higher quality housing to residents
		 - hdb (housing dev. board) set up (1960) \rightarrow build and provide public housing for sg's inc. pop.
	 + public housing programmes achieved success
		 - address the diverse needs of all residents
		 - > 80% of sg's pop. lives in hdb flats (2013)
2. *r.d.j., brazil*
	 + bairro carioca project
		 - comprises 2240 apartments which will house 10k people
		 - govt. partnership with private sector
			 + companies hired to build basic infrastructure of roads, sewerage & water; design and build housing units
*** provision of inclusive housing (sg)
**** definition
+ a city which provides all residents with adequate housing & access to all basic svcs. (tpt., rec.)
+ all residents feel a sense of belonging and actively contribute to the community
**** affordable housing
***** definition
+ housing that is priced at a reasonable cost such that residents still have enough money for other basic needs
***** how?
+ variety of housing types to cater to the diff. income grps.
	- private property / condominiums (high-income pop.)
	- public housing (low-income pop.)
+ types of public housing increased to meet residents' needs
	- studio apartments \rightarrow seniors
	- 3-room flats \rightarrow smaller families
***** examples
1. financial schemes
	 + subsidise the cost of flats
	 + additional cpf housing grant (ahg) (2006)
		 - helps low-income fam. buy their first flat
		 - families earning not more than S$5000 / month can qualify for a grant of up to S$40000, used to pay for flat
2. ethnic integration
	 + ethnic integ. policy (eip) (1989)
	 + promote racial integ. and harmony
		 - includes ppl. of diff. races in the nbh. by specifying ethnic quotae for each block
	 + creates opp. for interaction among residents from diverse bgs.
**** facilites & amenities for all ages
***** how?
+ impt. to provide range of facils. and amenities for diff. age grps.
+ retail shops, clinics, parks are common in nbhs.
***** example
1. 3-generation (3g) facilities
	 + playground, adult fitness corner, wellness stations (seniors)
	 + cater to the needs of multi generational fam.
2. seniors activity centres (sac)
	 + set up near hdb rental / studio apt. blocks (where the elderly usu. live)
	 + snrs. encouraged to spend time @ centres \rightarrow interact & exercise with others
3. gen. infrastructure
	 + corridors in residential dev.: min. width. - 1.5 m
		 - facil. access for ppl. using mobility aids (eg. wheelchairs)
**** strong sense of place & belonging
***** definition
+ sense of place = meaning and value people attach to a place as a res. of their exp. / unique. chars. of a place
***** why?
+ ppl. may regard places w. special meaning & rmb. these places fondly
+ spent much time there / had +ve exp.
+ more likely to dev. a sense of place & belonging
***** how?
+ distinctive phys. features \rightarrow give the place its visual quality, char. and identity
	- monuments
	- gardens
+ allows ppl to recog. and recall a place easily \rightarrow contrib. to sense of place & belonging
***** example
+ rounded balconise & spiral staircases of hdb flats (tiong bahru)
	- unique phys. feature \rightarrow may evoke a sense of place & belonging for tiong bahru residents
** end remarks
housing is an important basic need which impacts one's q.o.l.
with the rise in urban pop., cities face inc. pressure to provide sufficient housing.
the nature & extent of housing shortage varies between cities. thus, they have adopted diff. strategies to manage the issue of housing shortage.

although sg has achieved considerable success in providing quality housing, it needs to continue to be responsive to the changing needs & aspirations of its people.
as sg begins to exp. an ageing pop., facil. and amenities which provide care & support svcs. for the elderly would become inc. impt.

* transport
** causes of traffic congestion
*** separation of work & residential areas
**** explanation
+ people often work & live in different parts of the city
	- places of work often located away from housing areas
	- sep. of work & residential areas forces people to /commute/ (travel some distance between two places) between home & and place of work /on a reg. basis/
+ many people prefer to drive private vehicles (convenient / allows for flexibility)
	- high car ownership
	- massive no.s of cars that drive in and out of cbd (central business district)
**** example
1. *united states*
	 + total of 132.3m ppl. commute between work & residential areas daily
2. *singapore*
	 + avg. daily traffic vol.: 289k vehicles (entering cbd)
3. *uk*
	 + steady inc. in car ownership
		 - no. of fam. owning 1 car / 2 or more cars inc. over time
*** movement from one part of the city to another to obtain / provide goods & svcs.
**** exp.
+ ppl. may need to move about within city to *obtain* g&s
	- purchase gds. from specialised stores
	- attend classes in a diff. part of the city
	- wider range of g&s avail. in the city (compared to rural areas)
+ ppl. may also need to travel within city to *provide* g&s
	- wholesalers deliver to retail shp.
	- home delivery svcs. deliver products to homes
	- delivery of goods to diff. parts of city is carried out using diff. vehicles (frieght trucks, motorcycles)
*** inadeq. tpt. inf-str. & poor prov. of tpt. svcs.
**** def. / exp.
+ /inadequate tpt. inf-str./: city's tpt. facil. are incapable of handling amt. of traffic it receives
	- roads may not have enough lanes
	- netwk. may not be well connected
		+ lack of alternative routes \rightarrow congestion (esp. accident / peak hr.)
+ /tpt. svcs./: svcs. prov. to move ppl. & gds. from one loc. to another
	- /poor prov. of tpt. svcs./: city only has a small fleet of public buses & rail
		+ does not have enough of them to carry commuters
		+ overcrowded trains, buses; buses do not arrive freq.
		+ \therefore ppl. avoid taking pub. tpt.; buy cars to drive to wk. instead \rightarrow inc. vehicles on roads \rightarrow traffic cong.
**** eg.
+ *mumbai, india*
+ trains often filled to many times their capacity
+ buses caught in trf-cong. often filled with passengers
+ \therefore many ppl. turn to driving their own cars (priv-tpt.) \rightarrow more pleasant commute
	- car pop. inc. by 51%
	- 2006-7: 1.5m veh. (incl. 460k cars) \rightarrow 2012-3: 2.16m veh. (incl. 700k cars)
** impacts of trf-cong.
*** social
**** reduced productivity
***** def.
+ /productivity/: rate at which g&s are produced
	- measured in output per unit of labour
	- involves engaging in activities that bring about economic benefit
***** exp.
+ ppl spend more time commuting \therefore trf-cong. reduces productivity
+ tpt. system is inefficient \rightarrow productivity goes down \rightarrow economic loss for the country
+ rising expenses in fuels
+ higher tpt. cost (goods need to be delivered)
***** eg.
1. *singapore*
	 + econ. loss from inefficient tpt. amts. to 9% of the country's annual income per person (siemens, 2014)
	 + an efficient tpt-sys. can provide a city with up to us$238b in econ. val. annually by 2030
2. *lagos, nigeria*
	 + econ. loss can be as high as 28% of the country's ann. incm. per person
3. *philippines*
	 + losing 2.4b pesos (s$570m) / day in potential income due to trf-cong.
**** stress on phys. & ment. health
***** exp.
+ ppl. often exp. stress and anxiety \rightarrow negatively affect their phys. and ment. health
+ long travel times \rightarrow fatigue
	- more prone to losing conc. / falling asleep \rightarrow accident / death
+ exhaust fumes from idling veh. in traffic
	- incl. co2, co, particulate matter
	- long-term exposure: asthma, respiratory inflammation, lung disease
+ more prone to stress & frustration \rightarrow inc. chance of getting into fights / accidents on the road
*** env. impacts
**** air pollution
***** exp.
+ cars emit greenhouse gases (eg. co, co2) \rightarrow earth's temp. rise (trap heat)
+ other gases: no2, so2
+ vehicles remain stationary in trf-cong. / constantly accel. & brake (stop-start trf.) \rightarrow wasted fuel \rightarrow inc. air pollution & co2 emissions
+ other harmful air pollutants  \rightarrow poor air quality (smog)
	- difficulty in breathing, asthma, reduced resist. to lung infections, colds, eye irritation
	- exposure to smog can reduce life expectancy by u.t. 15 years (british medical journal, 2014)
	- slows down plant growth \rightarrow harm the env.
	- tiny pollutant particles deposited on soil & water \rightarrow enter food chain \rightarrow poison animals
***** eg.
+ *china*
+ smog
	- resemble nuclear winter, slows down photosynthesis in plants
	- pm 2.5 particles hit 505 $\mu$g / cu.m.  (recommended level - who: 25)
	- flights grounded, highways closed, tourists deterred
		+ 11.2k ppl visited forbidden city (beijing), 1/4 of the avg. daily visits
**** noise pollution
***** exp.
+ rumbling of engines
+ honking
***** eg.
1. *stats* (uk noise assoc., 2009)
	 + road traffic is the biggest cause of noise pollution in the uk, disturbing > 12m ppl
2. *kolkata, india*
	 + drivers honk their cars very freq.
	 + in 2010, drivers honk at an avg. of 1 honk / 5 s
		 - honks are usu. > 65 db (over lawful limit of 55 db for residential areas)
	 + prolonged exp. to harmful noise can trigger heart disease, high blood pressure, mental illness
** strategies to manage trf-cong.
*** making public tpt a choice mode
**** integ. pub. tpt. sys.
***** exp.
+ a pub. tpt. sys. that is seen as whole, regardless of the modes of tpt.
+ encourage ppl. to use pub. tpt.
***** adv.
 + more conv., accessible, efficient. ppl. can make use of diff. modes of tpt. to get to a place quickly
***** dis.
+ req. extensive planning & $
	- may not be feasible in all countries
***** eg.
1. *tokyo, jp*
	 + all pub. tpt. modes (train, tram, bus) can be paid for using a rechargeable contactless smart card
		 - speeds up mvmt. of ppl taking pub. tpt \rightarrow commuting is smooth and conv.
	 + all modes timed to precision
		 - allows commuters to plan travel routes more effectively
2. *sg*
	 + six tpt. hubs with bus interchanges (fully integ. w. rail svcs. & retail activities) (2014)
	 + over the next 10y, another 7 integ. tpt. hubs will be built
		 - have linking platforms from road - rail
		 - escalators \rightarrow improve accessibility & speed up bus-train transfers
	 + ez-link (contactless card)
		 - same ticketing system
		 - smoother transfer between buses and trains
**** bus lane schemes
***** def.
+ lanes specially set aside for priv./pub. buses on specific days / times
***** exp.
+ buses able to enter/exit bus stops smoothly & quickly
+ regulations that give buses priority are needed
	- prov. faster / uninterrutped journeys for commuters
***** adv.
+ allow buses to move quickly, will not be held up during congestion
+ arrive on schedule more often even during peak hr.
	- make travelling by bus more appealing
***** dis.
+ success of bus lane schemes depends on drivers' compliance
+ allocating a lane for buses dec. road capacity for other drivers
	- may lead to traffic cong. for private car users
***** eg.
#+CAPTION: bus lane schemes
[[./buslanes.png]]
**** expansion of rail ntwk.
***** exp.
+ inc. the no. of loc. trains can reach
	1. more tracks can be laid \rightarrow rail ntwk. covers more areas
	2. more stations can be built \rightarrow more loc. have access to trains
***** adv.
+ trains have very high capacities \rightarrow tpt. more ppl. at each time
+ ppl can travel to more dest. by train, some of which were only accessible by car/bus
***** dis.
+ rail network building is $$$
+ proposed rail lines may cut through housing estates & buildings
	- residents/businesses may have to bear construction noise / give up property
	- inconveniences for residents in the area
***** eg.
1. *dallas, tx, us*
	 + dallas area rapid transit (dart) (1996)
	 + largest light-rail sys. in the country, and is continuing to expand
	 + started with 14 stations, total combined length of 17.4 km
	 + 2014: 61 stations, total combined length of 137 km
2. *singapore*
	 + land tpt. master plan (2030)
		 - build more mrt lines (cross-island line, jurong region line)
		 - add new stations to existing lines (ccl, dtl, nel)
		 - rail ntwk. will double from 178km - 360km
		 - 8 in 10 homes will be located 10 min away from a train stn.
**** inc. cap. and freq. of buses & rail
***** exp.
+ bus & rail sys. can be upgraded to carry more ppl. and arrive more freq.
+ tpt. op. can put sys. in place so that buses & trains arrive at scheduled times
***** adv.
+ more ppl. can be transported to places within a short time
***** dis.
+ inc. the freq. & cap. of buses/trains could be $$$
***** eg.
1. *curitiba, brazil*
	 + brt (bus rapid transit) system
	 + inc. cap. of bus sys.
		 - dedicated bus lanes for articulated buses, div. into 3 sections
		 - \because buses can carry more passengers \therefore brt can tpt. ~2m passengers / day
	 + buses arrive more freq.
		 - as often as every 90 s
		 - on-board sensors \rightarrow trf. lights stay green when buses approach
		 - \therefore reduces no. of times buses stop \rightarrow move at steady pace
2. *sg*
	 + bus
		 - 2012: govt. partner with bus ops. to inc. cap. & freq. of buses (bus service enhancement programme)
			 + expected to red. waiting times for buses
	 + train
		 - 2011: more trains added to existing lines
		 - 2014: more trains cont. to be added
		 - 2016: 28 trains added to nsl and ewl; 16 trains added to sengkang & punggol lrt
		 - upgraded train signaling sys.
			 + allow trains to arrive safely every 100 s
			 + carry 20% more passengers
*** managing road usage
**** road pricing
***** def.
+ a trf. mgmt. sys. which charges drivers when they use certain roads
***** exp.
+ drivers req. to pay more during peak hr.
+ discourage the use of certain roads
+ no. & loc. of gantries have to be determined
***** adv.
+ higher $ discourage driving during p.h. \rightarrow drivers use alternative tpt. (public bus/train)
***** dis.
+ drivers avoid erp \rightarrow traffic diverted to other roads \rightarrow congestion on other roads
***** eg.
1. *singapore*
	 + erp (electronic rd. pricing)
	 + 72 erp gantries set up (2012)
		 - located in more-cong. areas
	 + cashcards inserted into in-vehicle units (ius)
	 + each time a vehicle passes through an erp gantry, an amt. is deducted from its cashcard via short-range radio comm.
	 + success
		 - 15% reduction in trf. vol. on the rd. during peak hr.
		 - avg. expressway speeds: 35 km/h \rightarrow 55 km/h
		 - trf. reduced by 16% within erp zones
		 - trf. vol. in cbd during peak hr. remains relatively stable, despite inc. car ownership over the years
2. *stockholm, sweden*
	 + stockholm congestion tax applies to veh. leaving/entering the cbd (2007)
	 + a bill is sent to the veh. to inform driver of the amt. to pay
	 + traffic vol. fell by 24% during p.h. (cong. charge secretariat, stockholm)
**** increase parking fees
***** exp.
+ inc. driving $, esp. to and from cbd
+ encourage pub. tpt.
+ ppl seek alt. means of tpt. such as pub. tpt. & carpooling
	- carpooling: grp. of ppl. travelling tgt. in the same car & sharing the $
		+ save $ on fuel, parking, cong.
		+ reduces no. of veh. on road
***** adv.
+ high parking $ add to the $ of owning & using cars, discouraging private car ownership
***** dis.
+ drivers may resort to illegal parking \rightarrow block traffic / pose a danger to other drivers
***** eg.
+ *shanghai, china*
+ city govt. plans to inc. car parking charges
	- current:
		+ downtown: 15 yuan (us$2.40) for the 1st h, 10 yuan for every additional 1/2h
		+ inner ring road: 10 yuan for the 1st h, 6 yuan for every additional 1/2h
+ target:
	- keep no. of reg. cars in central shanghai below 2.5m
		+ current: over 2.1m (1.8m are private veh.)
**** enhanced traffic monitoring
***** exp.
+ traffic monitoring can alert drivers of trf-cong. \rightarrow they can avoid travelling on the road
***** adv.
+ drivers can avoid places w. trf-cong.
***** dis.
+ trf. monitoring only encourages drivers to drive elsewhere
+ does not reduce no. of veh. on the road
***** eg. (singapore)
1. emas (expressway advisory & monitoring system)
	 + vehicle breakdown / accident \rightarrow live info made avail. to drivers on the roads \rightarrow drivers can opt to take alt. routes
2. glide (green link determining)
	 + computerised trf. light signalling
		 - detects vehicles, pedestrians, maj. rd. jn. \rightarrow adj. the green time accordingly
		 - when more vehicles detected, trf. signal remains green \rightarrow allow veh. to drive through the trf. jn.
		 - trf. signals at nearby jn. are coordinated at the start of their green times \rightarrow drivers can catch the 'green wave' \rightarrow travel from one jn. to the next w/o stop
*** other measures
**** telecommuting
***** def. and exp.
+ /telecommuting/: work arrangemt. where employees wfh or @ a loc. near home
	- do not have to travel to office
+ made possible by tech: internet, computers, phone lines
+ ppl. can stay in contact with colleagues/clients although not phys. in the office
+ $\therefore$ eliminates need for ppl. to commute to/from workplaces \rightarrow reducing no. of veh. on the road \rightarrow reduces trf-cong.
***** adv.
+ do not need to travel out of their residential areas to go to work
	 - reduces no. of drivers & pub. tpt. passengers during p.h.
***** dis.
+ when millions of ppl. change their work arrangment, local servers may go down and cease to function temporarily \rightarrow more inconv.
**** cycling
***** exp.
+ bicycles are env.-friendly (0 carbon emissions)
+ convenient (mobility & flexibility)
***** adv.
+ mode of tpt. that provides flexibility and mobility
+ env.-friendly, sustainable
***** dis.
+ cycling lanes v. near to motor veh. on the road \rightarrow dangerous for cyclists
+ layout, trf., topography \rightarrow may be unsuitable for cycling
***** eg.
+ *copenhagen, denmark*
+ govt. built ntwk. of wide cycling lanes, covering a large part of the city
	- v. conv. for ppl. to travel from place - place
+ numerous bicycle parking lots for cyclists
+ cycling now an impt. means of tpt.
	- 52% ppl. in the city commute by bicycle to wk. / sch. (2013, city of copenhagen)
