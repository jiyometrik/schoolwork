\section{Introduction}
\Glsxtrfull{we} is often considered one of the cleanest ways to produce
electricity, being cheap and eco-friendly \cite{premalatha_2014_wind}.
This leads many countries to increase WE investments to counter the
rapid depletion of \glsxtrfull{ff}, an energy source widely known
to be non-renewable.
By erecting turbines in favourable areas with strong winds, \glsxtrfull{wf}
are established: the mechanical energy
winds carry turn the blades of the \glsxtrfull{wt}, after which
it is converted to electrical energy sent to a power plant for
consumption \cite{nejad_2022_wind}. \glsxtrshort{wt} are distributed over a large
land area interconnected with said power collection system. Because
\glsxtrshort{we} generated correlates with wind speed, onshore
\glsxtrshort{wf} are most
prevalent near coasts \cite{davis_2023_the}, where wind speeds are the highest.

\section{On wind energy}
China is becoming increasingly aware of the environmental detriments
\glsxtrlong{ff} bring.
International carbon dioxide emissions already reside at 35 billion
megatonnes today \cite{trndle_2020_tradeoffs},
with \glsxtrshort{ff} exploitation comprising 48 per cent of China's
emissions \cite{zhang_2012_large}---a
large margin that requires reduction.
No doubt continued \glsxtrshort{ff} exploitation hastens global warming
and endangers
natural and human life. Because \glsxtrshort{we} produces near zero
carbon emissions,
environmentally conscious governments and companies have turned to it
to reduce their
emissions, slowing global warming down if done on a large scale.
In the US, 96 million megatonnes of emissions were avoided by
introducing \glsxtrshort{we} \cite{chen_2016_growing}, establishing it
as a compelling \glsxtrfull{re} source for worldwide carbon
emission reductions.

\glsxtrshort{we} has also become increasingly affordable. Modern technological
improvements to the turbine have allowed it to generate a record power
output, while its cost has dropped dramatically.
